# Inspiration
Wherever we find unity, there is always diversity. Inculcating the extravagance of this diverse divergence and bringing peace amongst fellow us would make the earth a better place to live on.

# What it does
It is a website that helps us explore the diversity of the earth through fashion, food and tourism. You can travel the seven wonders of world, take photos and share with people.

# How I built it
The website has been built by using bootstrap studio. The echoAR has been embedded in our project by using iframe and qr code. All you need to do is to scan the qr code and see the wonders through AR. Also you can take photos alongside the seven wonders by using sparkAR background effect.
